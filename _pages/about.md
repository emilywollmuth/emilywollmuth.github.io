I’m a PhD student in the Department of Microbiology at Cornell University where I study symbiotic intestinal bacteria associated with herbivorous fish living in coral reef ecosystems. I’m originally from Minnesota and attended Hamline University in Saint Paul, MN where I completed a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in English. In my free time, I enjoy cooking and baking, reading, hiking, and playing tennis.
