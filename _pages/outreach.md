## Cornell Graduate Womxn in Science (GWiS)
* Executive Board Member since 2019
  * Treasurer, 2020-present 
  * Community Outreach Chair, 2019-2020
  
We are committed to improving the culture of the sciences at Cornell and in Ithaca with a combination of outreach and advocacy. We uphold that improving the scientific culture to help women and gender minorities thrive in the sciences requires improving the working conditions for everyone in our community, especially marginalized groups.

As a member of the GWiS Executive Board I am involved in planning programming and outreach activites for our members. In the Spring of 2020, I organized a Science Supply Drive to support [Ithaca Free Science Workshop](http://www.freescienceworkshop.org/).
